## Guided media/Wired Media/Bounded Media
- provide a conduit from one device to another, 
- twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable.
- It is defined as the physical medium through which the signals are transmitted.

There are 3 major types of Guided Media: 

Twisted pairs are made up of two insulated copper wires that are twisted together. The twisting is done to help cancel exterior electromagnetic interference. Crosstalk interference can come from other pairs within a cable

(i) Twisted Pair Cable â€“ 
- Twisted pair is a physical media made up of a pair of insulated copper wires twisted with each other.
- The twisting is done to help cancel exterior electromagnetic interference.
- Crosstalk interference can come from other pairs within a cable.
- The degree of reduction in noise interference is determined by the no of turns/foot. Increasing the number of turns per foot decreases noise interference.

## Twisted Pair is of two types: 

## Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP): 
- consists of two insulated copper wires twisted around one another. 
- This type of cable has the ability to block interference and 
- does not depend on a physical shield for this purpose.
- UTP performance : attenuation is inversely proportional to diameter
 
## Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):
- This type of cable consists of a special jacket (a copper braid covering or a foil shield) to block external interference. 

# Coaxial Cable
- outer plastic covering containing an insulation layer made of PVC/Teflon
- 2 parallel conductors each having a separate insulated protection cover. 

## The coaxial cable transmits information in two modes: 
- Baseband transmission: process of transmitting a single signal at high speed.
- Broadband transmission: process of transmitting multiple signals simultaneously.

# Optical Fiber Cable  
- uses electrical signals for communication.
- uses the concept of reflection of light through a core made up of glass or plastic.
- The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the cladding.
- holds the optical fibers coated in plastic that are used to send the data by pulses of light.
- The plastic coating protects the optical fibers from heat, cold, electromagnetic interference from other types of wiring.

# Basic elements of Fibre optic cable:

## Core:
- narrow strand of glass or plastic 
- light transmission area 
- The more the area of the core, the more light will be transmitted
 
## Cladding:  
- concentric layer of glass 
- The main functionality is to provide the lower refractive index at the core interface to cause the reflection within the core so that the light waves are transmitted through the fiber.

## Jacket: 
- protective coating consisting of plastic 
- preserves the fiber strength 
- absorbs shock and 
- Provides extra fiber protection.

# Propagation modes of optical fiber:

## On the basis of the Number of Modes:
<pre>
(a). Single-mode fiber optic cable:
small diametral core that allows only one mode of light to propagate.
Because of this, the number of light reflections decreases, lowering attenuation and creating the ability for the signal to travel further. 
high cladding diameter (70um) and 
The difference between the refractive index of core and cladding is very small.
There is no dispersion i.e. no degradation of the signal during traveling through the fiber. 

(b). Multi-mode fiber:
has a large diametral core that allows multiple modes of light to propagate. 
Because of this, the number of light reflections increases, creating the ability for more data to pass through at a given time. 
There is signal degradation due to multimode dispersion. 
Because of the high dispersion and attenuation rate with this type of fiber, the quality of the signal is reduced over long distances. 
The diameter of the cladding is (70um). 
The relative refractive index difference is also greater than single mode fiber.
There are two categories on the basis of Multi-mode fiber i.e. Step Index Fiber and Graded Index Fiber. Basically these are categories under the types of optical fiber on the basis of Refractive Index.

## On the basis of Refractive Index:
<pre>
(a). Step-index optical fiber:
Due to its large core, some of the light rays that make up the digital pulse may travel a direct route, whereas others zigzag as they bounce off the cladding. These alternate paths cause the different groups of light rays, referred to as modes, to arrive separately at the receiving point. 
The pulse, an aggregate of different modes, begins to spread out, losing its well-defined shape. 
The need to leave spacing between pulses to prevent overlapping, limits the amount of information that can be sent. 
The refractive index of the core and cladding is constant. 
The rays of light propagate through it in the form of meridional rays which cross the fiber axis during every reflection at the core-cladding boundary.

(b). Graded index optical fiber:
Contains a core in which the refractive index decreases gradually from the center axis out toward the cladding. 
The higher refractive index at the center makes the light rays moving down the axis advance more slowly than those near the cladding.
Due to the graded index, light in the core curves helically rather than zigzag off the cladding, reducing its travel distance. 
The shortened path and the higher speed allow light at the periphery to arrive at a receiver at about the same time as the slow but straight rays in the core axis. 
The result: digital pulse suffers less dispersion. 
The cladding has a uniform refractive index. 
The light rays propagate through it in the form of skew rays or helical rays.
